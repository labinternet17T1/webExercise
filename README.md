# WEB

In this repository you'll find the second exercise solved. Now you need to create a Controller class that calls
to the DAO class. You can use the one you created for the former exercise.

Once you have the controller create an Advice class for printing some log messages (as in the example seen at class). 

Now you need to create a web interface where a user can:
* List all the classrooms
* List a single classroom given its id
* Create a new classromm (validating the fields)
